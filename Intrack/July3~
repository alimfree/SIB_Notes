Development Lifecycle

plan target build test merge deliver

planning
	- Figuring out the end goal without becoming too inflexible 
	- Write up a roadmap to plan out goals 
	- Wireframs to sketch thoughts and tentative outline for apps
	- swagger apagee, an api spec, rest action verbs to identify 
	  the functionality of the webapp.

	  document the build process. 

	  
target 
	- create actionable tasks to deliver a final product. 
	- create the smallest version of your product quickly. 
	- focus in on the essential value add of your product. 

	when building apps and adding features ask the following 		questions
	- Build Independent tasks
	- negotiable "ask the tough quesitons like is this really  		  necessary.
	- Valuabe "how will this add value to our product.
	- Estimatable "how do you estimate the cost and benefit of
	  features.
	- Small, "how much time will this take can we make a simpler 		  version.  
	- Testable, figure out how to test the accuracy of your 	  estimates.

build 	
	- A clever person solves a problem a wise person avoids it.
	- Think about what matters and only build the essentials
	- reuse. find other things out there that you can use instead 
	  of rebuilding existing software. 
	- Lean UX or Lean Startup two must reads. 
	- Don't be too loyal to a technology, use it until it no longer
	  solves your problems. 
	- Don't repeat yourself
	- Technical debt = owing features to users. Balancing 		  technical and practical solutions to prioritize problems. 

Test 
	- black box vs white box testing. Blackbox testing doesn't tie 
	  a solution to a specific implementation and focuses on the 
	  results. White box testing you are given the implementation 
	  and then focus on how to solve the problem.

	- Don't cut out time to test your code making sure you
	  understand the specifications. Also this simplifies complex 
	  processes.

	penetration testing hiring whitehat hackers. 

Merge 
	Collaborating on projects with other developers. 
	- making small merges and merging frequently. 

Deliver
	Try and deliver many features quickly and not one feature after
	months of preparation. 
	Measure your progress and map them to your goals and planning
