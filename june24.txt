Return Values
	At the end of every method we create the last value "=>" will return whatever the last value is.

			ex.
			 > something = if false
			 >	"bad"
			 >else
			 >	"good"
			 >end

			 >something
			 > =>"good"
			 tertiary operator:
			 >something = false ? "bad" : "good"
			 > something
			 > "good"
