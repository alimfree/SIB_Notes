Ruby best habits
	restful 
	If the added characters don't add value, don't include them


Return Values
	At the end of every method, we create the last value "=>" will return whatever 
	the last value is.

			ex.
			 > something = if false
			 >	"bad"
			 >else
			 >	"good"
			 >end

			 >something
			 > =>"good"
			 tertiary operator:
			 >something = false ? "bad" : "good"
			 > something
			 > "good"


Scope
 "See Treehouse"

Symbols 
	"See Treehouse video"
usually used 

Creating a rails App. http://cykod.github.io/ToDoZer/creating-rails-app.html

Rails App tree 
App
 Controller takes input from user and passes it to the model
 
 Model includes all the application's business logic. Think of it as writing 
 	   an api including all the methods needed to run the app
 
 View only used to take information from model and display data to the user
 	helpers = where methods that abstract from view logic are placed and to be 
 	later called in the view

 mailers if application needs to send emails, you can set this up here


Crafting a home page http://cykod.github.io/ToDoZer/crafting-a-homepage.html

Everytime you modify config files and gem file you must restart your application 
for the changes to take place except for routes Files

Scaffolding
	gives a basic restful template of a rails application to work with. 
	
	Unfortunately, this also creates many extra files that are 
	unnecessary in the real world.

Twitter Bootstrap
	override and change styling variables http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/customize.html
