Rails migrations 
	- are classes used to make modifying data 
	  tables easy
	- Rails uses rake commands to run migrations.
	- Rails also knows how to reverse changes made
	  by migration commands.

Rails Opinionated
	- There's no "right way" to do something in Perl. 
	  In contrast, there is one correct "Rails way."
	- Less problems will arise if you follow rails 
	  conventions. 

Rails Omakase
	- Some of the best developers decided which 
	  conventions are best and built rails with
	  this in mind.

Convention Over Configuratoin
	- Rails makes assumptions about configuration
	  based on Rails Conventions. Eg. When you create 
	  A modle  object "User" rails will automatically
	  save data into database table named "users" 
	  without any extra configuration.

DRY
	- Rails developers use a Dont-Repeat-Yourself 
	  principle; simply avoid duplication to skirt 
	  complexity and unintentional bugs.
